First, we head over to the manual page for man

# $ man man
There I found that to search for a man page, you run the following command,

# $ man -k challenge
jphdclecip (1)       - print the flag!
This returns jphdclecip as a manual page of the /challenge/challenge program, so we read it's manual,

# $ man jphclecip
This returns the manual for jphclecip, which contains instructions and details that to get the flag, we need to use the --jphdcl NUM argument with NUM=869,

# $ /challenge/challenge --jphdcl 869****
