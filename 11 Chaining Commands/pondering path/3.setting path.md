First we create a file win with vim,

# cat /flag
Then, we make the file executable by the user,

# $ chmod u+x win
This challenge required a bit of thinking, because simply replacing the PATH to /home/hacker, where our win file was located would not work, since we had to also include the path where the cat command was located in the file structure. So I searched to figure out how to add to the PATH variable instead of replacing it and then ran the following commands,

# $ export PATH=/home/hacker:$PATH
# $ export PATH=/bin:$PATH
# $ /challenge/run
