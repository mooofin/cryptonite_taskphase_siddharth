Run the commands to run the program, then suspend it, and then background it (since we cannot resume a program directly into the foreground), and then foreground it,

# $ /challenge/run
To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the 
background, and *then* foreground it without re-suspending it! You can 
background me with Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if 
you're not ready to do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!

$ bg /challenge/run

Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times 
to scroll this text out. After that, resume me into the foreground with 'fg'; 
I'll wait.


# $ fg /challenge/run
/challenge/run
YES! Great job! I'm now running in the foreground. Hit Enter for your flag!
