I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and 
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root         328 S+   bash /challenge/run
root         330 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the

Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if you're not ready to 
do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!

Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times 
to scroll this text out.
