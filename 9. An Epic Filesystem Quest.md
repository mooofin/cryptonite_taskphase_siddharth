In this challenge, the goal is to execute a series of commands to locate the flag file. When the clue mentions the file is "delayed," we should use the cd command to navigate. However, if the message warns that the file will "autodestruct" upon entering the directory, we should use the ls command instead.
$ cd /
$ ls -a

Tubular find!
The next clue is in: /usr/share/help/ko


$ cd /usr/share/help/ko
$ ls
MEMO  gedit
$ cat MEMO
Yahaha, you found me!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/tools/include/nolibc

The next clue is **delayed** --- it will not become readable until you enter the directory with 'cd'.


$ cd /opt/linux/linux-5.4/tools/include/nolibc
$ ls -a
.  ..  TRACE  nolibc.h
$ cat TRACE
Great sleuthing!
The next clue is in: /usr/share/racket/pkgs/typed-racket-more/typed/web-server/configuration/compiled

The next clue is **delayed** --- it will not become readable until you enter the directory with 'cd'.


$ cd /usr/share/racket/pkgs/typed-racket-more/typed/web-server/configuration/compiled
$ ls -a
.  ..  HINT  responders_rkt.dep  responders_rkt.zo
$ cat HINT
Tubular find!
The next clue is in: /opt/aflplusplus/frida_mode/test/perf

The next clue is **delayed** --- it will not become readable until you enter the directory with 'cd'.


$ cd /opt/aflplusplus/frida_mode/test/perf
$ ls -a
.  ..  DISPATCH  GNUmakefile  Makefile  perf.c
$ cat DISPATCH
Yahaha, you found me!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/tools/perf/python


$ cd /opt/linux/linux-5.4/tools/perf/python
$ ls -a
.  ..  NOTE  tracepoint.py  twatch.py
$ cat NOTE
Congratulations, you found the clue!
The next clue is in: /usr/share/racket/collects/xml

The next clue is **hidden** --- its filename starts with a '.' character. You'll need to look for it using special options to 'ls'.


$ cd /usr/share/racket/collects/xml
$ ls -a
.   .GIST     main.rkt  plist.rkt  xexpr.rkt
..  compiled  path.rkt  private    xml.rkt
$ cat .GIST
Yahaha, you found me!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/gpu/drm/mga

The next clue is **delayed** --- it will not become readable until you enter the directory with 'cd'.


$ cd /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/gpu/drm/mga
$ ls -a
.   ALERT     mga_dma.c  mga_drv.h    mga_irq.c    mga_warp.c
..  Makefile  mga_drv.c  mga_ioc32.c  mga_state.c
$ cat ALERT
Lucky listing!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/dax/pmem

Watch out! The next clue is **trapped**. You'll need to read it out without 'cd'ing into the directory; otherwise, the clue will self destruct!


$ ls /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/dax/pmem
MESSAGE-TRAPPED  Makefile  compat.c  core.c  pmem.c

$ cat /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/dax/pmem/MESSAGE-TRAPPED
